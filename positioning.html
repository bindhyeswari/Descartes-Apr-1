        Auto-margins can center an absolutely positioned element inside its containing block.
        For this to work, you have to
        specify the offset properties (of opposite sides) with same values, i.e. by setting left:0; right:0; for horizontal centering and top:0; bottom:0; for vertical centering,
        set dimensions along the axis you want to center along,
        enable auto-margins along the axis you want to center along.
        Internet Explorer note: IE can not relate absolutely positioned elements to opposite sides of containing block, so only one of the offset properties is used. This brings the element out of balance and renders auto-margins useless. A workaround is use relative positioning for the element to be centered and wrap it with an absolutely positioned element with top, left and right set to 0.
